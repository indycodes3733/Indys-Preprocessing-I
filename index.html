    <div class="about-india">

      <p>I was am orginally from Boston, Massachusetts but have been living in Atlanta
        Georgia for over 10 years. I have always been very interested in computers.
        I wanted to know all the inside moving parts and how they worked so I started
        out doing basic maintenance on them. I then began to have an interest in webpages,
        I wanted to know how all the parts of a webpage or website were made,
         how they existed,and functioned. This is how my interest in web development began; 
         I started trying to teach myself HTML and CSS. Although I grasped some very basic concepts, I wanted
        delve deeper and I decided to attend Lambda School.</p>
